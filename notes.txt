===============
SET UP
===============
to start a new project:
dotnet new console --framework net7.0

run a project with "dotnet run" which runs the Program.cs in that directory
or with coderunner (already set up)

Console.Write() -> [console.log()]

====================================================STRINGS
\t is tab -- \n is linebreak
"Hello \"World\"!" -> \ escapes in a string

Console.WriteLine(@"    c:\source\repos    
        (this is where your code goes)"); -> @"" is a verbatim string literal that keeps all whitespace. it also keeps in \ as literals

\u1111 -> \u + four character code is a unicode character

string message = $"{greeting} {firstName}!"; -> kino string interpolation (just like backtics in JS)

Can combine them into @$"" for both interpolation and verbatim
